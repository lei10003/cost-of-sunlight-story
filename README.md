# The Cost of Sunlight (story)


## Sunlight & Rent: An Urban Exploration in NYC

### Project Aim

The primary goal of this project was to explore the relationship between sunlight exposure and rental prices in neighborhoods surrounding Prospect Park, New York City. It stands as a unique attempt to visualize how urban design and the quest for sunlight affect the cost of living in a dense urban environment.

### Key Findings

This exploration serves as an initial look into the relationship between sunlight exposure and rental prices. While it might be intuitively believed that more sunlight correlates with higher rent, this project presents a more nuanced picture. The interplay between sunlight exposure, rental prices, and affordability in terms of per capita and median household income varies across different neighborhoods surrounding Prospect Park. It hints at the possibility of deeper, more complex dynamics at play that influence how sunlight - a desired amenity in urban living - is valued in the rental market of New York City.

### Data Collection

The data was collected from apartment listings available on Localize.city during Summer 2023, focusing primarily on studio and one-bedroom apartments. The key attributes considered were rent, sunlight exposure, and living arrangements.

### Data Analysis

The data analysis process involved cleaning, organizing, and visualizing the gathered apartment listing data. The resulting visualization provides an interactive exploration of how sunlight exposure and rent interact across the analyzed neighborhoods.

### Skills and Growth

The project stands as a learning opportunity in creating narratives from data, interactivity in data visualization, and gaining a deeper understanding of urban living. It involved mastering the craft of visual storytelling and grappling with the nuances of housing data.

### Challenges and Future Directions

Creating a responsive design that works across devices posed a challenge due to time constraints. If given more time, it would be worthwhile to extend the analysis to other parts of New York City and possibly other dense urban environments. There is also an opportunity to dig deeper into the multiple factors influencing rental prices, with sunlight exposure being one of them.
