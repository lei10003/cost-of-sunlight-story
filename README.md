# The Cost of Sunlight (story)


## Sunlight & Rent: An Urban Exploration in NYC

This project takes you on an interactive journey through the correlation between sunlight exposure and rental prices in the neighborhoods surrounding Prospect Park, New York City.

### Project Description

In the shadows of New York City's skyscrapers, sunlight becomes a tangible, quantifiable commodity. Using data from apartment listings available on Localize.city during Summer 2023, this project investigates how the quest for good sunlight influences the cost of living.

As we ascend our metaphorical building, each 'floor' or step reveals a different neighborhood, providing insights about how sunlight exposure impacts rental prices. This is urban living under a new lens, where the competition for sunlight in the shadows of skyscrapers becomes a tangible, quantifiable commodity.

### Key Features

*Interactive scrolling narrative
*Visual representations of apartment listings based on their sunlight exposure
*Comparison of rental prices based on sunlight exposure
*Demographic data on each neighborhood's population

### Limitations

Due to technical constraints, this project is best viewed on desktop or tablet devices. The interactive elements may not function as intended on mobile devices.

### Conclusion

This project concludes with a call-to-action to city planners, architects, and urban designers, urging a rethink of our cities in a way that equitable access to sunlight is no longer a privilege, but a right for all.

### Future Work

While this project focuses on the neighborhoods surrounding Prospect Park, there is scope to expand the analysis to other parts of New York City or other dense urban environments. Future work may also delve deeper into the various factors that influence rental prices in addition to sunlight exposure, such as building age, proximity to amenities, and more.
